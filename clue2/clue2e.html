      <h2>Clue 2</h2>
      <div class="poem">
        <p>I sit near a mind that sparked many a light,<br>
          Inventive, resourceful, a genius of flight.<br>
          Where machines and motors took their first stand,<br>
          A pioneer's legacy across the land.<br>
          Yet just a stone's throw from this man of fame,<br>
          I offer fuel of a different name.<br>
          Not for engines or gears, but for the soul,<br>
          Where minds take a break, and bellies find their goal.<br>
          What am I, this place of rest,<br>
          Near a creator whose work was the best?<br> 
          </p>
